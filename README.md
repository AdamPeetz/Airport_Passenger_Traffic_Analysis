### Factors contributing to passenger traffic: An exploration of correlating variables

	3 factors that impact airport passenger traffic are demand, connectivity, and competition. The demand for airline travel is based on business and leisure spending. More money available for these pursuits drives higher volumes of traffic through local airports. Passenger traffic is also based on the number of connections an airport has. Airports with many connections serve as hubs to smaller regional airports. Passenger count is also impacted by competition from nearby airports. An airport may have potential passengers served by a nearby neighbor. (Rodrigue, 2020) The purpose of this paper is a mechanic exploration of the factors impacting passenger traffic. It will prove the correlation between these variables, with discussion focused on the 5 busiest airports.
